# Introduction to React: Assessment

## Objectives

1. Demonstrate mastery of the basics of React
2. Build something cool!

## Outline

As with other assessments, this lab should be very open-ended.

Students should definitely need to integrate with remote data, and
their applications should show a reasonably complete understanding
of the React component lifecycle.

Students should also be able to demonstrate the difference between
props and state, and they'll be able to show that they understand the
difference between "smart" and "dumb" components. (And hopefully
they'll show a certain fondness for the dumb ones.)

Their apps should also make use of different events — they can at
least respond to form inputs — and their apps should handle event
weirdness with aplomb.
